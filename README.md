# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using SwiftUI. The game allows you to play against an AI opponent.

It looks simple but winning this game is hard because;
* If AI can win, then AI wins.
* If AI can't win, then block our winning chances.

**In a match, the first one to get 3 points wins.**

## Features
* Play Tic Tac Toe against the computer AI.
* Keep track of points for both the player and the computer.
* Responsive UI design using SwiftUI.

## Gameplay
* Tap on a square to make your move.
* The AI will automatically make its move after yours.
* The game will notify you when you win, lose, or draw a round.
* Keep playing to increase your score!

## How to Use
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the project in Xcode.
* Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical device.
